# Automated-Excel-Responses-with-GPT3

This repository contains code for an Excel-GPT-3 interface that generates automated responses for prompts using OpenAI's GPT-3 API. It uses Gradio for input/output interface, making it easy to use even for non-technical users. This tool is useful for generating responses for a large number of prompts in an Excel file. Please be aware that costs are incurred when using the GPT-3 API and an individual API-key for OpenAI is required.

You can use the repository in conjunction with the 'Search-Buddy' repository that is also available on our Githubpage. The Search-Buddy repository enables to extract data from PDFs into an Excel. Since GPT3 contains a maximum length of about 4000 tokens, Search Buddy can help by extracting the already relevant text from the PDF into an Excel. This excel can in turn be read by chatgpt through this repository (i.e. 'Automated-Excel-Responses-with-GPT3').

**Installation**

To use this tool, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal: 

pip install pandas
pip install os
pip install gradio
pip install openai

**Usage**

To use the tool, simply copy the code available in the repository and run the python script.

This will start the Gradio interface, where you can upload an Excel file containing prompts and generate automated responses using GPT-3. The resulting responses are added as a new column in the Excel file and saved as a new output file. 

**Configuration**

To configure the GPT-3 API, you need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable called Open_AI_Key. You can get an API key by signing up for OpenAI's GPT-3 API.

You can also modify the GPT-3 configuration by changing the model_config dictionary in the gpt() function, including the 'prompt' (instructions for the GPT-3 model). The function also contains various parameters that control the behavior of the GPT-3 model, such as the temperature, maximum number of tokens, and frequency penalty.
